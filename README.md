# Fraud-Prediction-using-Transformer-Based-Models-


# its a very vital project fore the tech field 
Building a Fraud Prediction System using Transformer-based models involves leveraging the powerful capabilities of Transformers to detect fraudulent behavior in transactional data. Typically, such data includes transaction histories, user behaviors, or financial records, where Transformers excel in understanding the complex relationships between various features over time.
# project overview 

Sequence-based Fraud Detection: Analyze sequences of transactions to identify patterns indicative of fraud.
Transformer Model: Leverage a Transformer architecture for better handling of long-range dependencies between features.
Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual or fraudulent behavior by comparing current transactions to typical patterns.
Feature Engineering: Preprocess and create meaningful features from transaction data to improve model performance.
Tools & Libraries:
Python: Primary programming language.
PyTorch or TensorFlow: For building and training Transformer models.
Pandas, Numpy: For data handling and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics like AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hugging Face's Transformer library: For leveraging pre-trained models if needed.
Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for data exploration and fraud analysis.
Dataset:
Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset: This dataset contains real-world credit card transactions and labels them as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. It has 284,807 transactions, with 492 being frauds.
Features: Time, V1-V28 (principal components), Amount, Class (1 = Fraud, 0 = Non-fraud).
Project Breakdown:
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Load and preprocess the dataset.
Create meaningful features from transactional data, such as time-based features or interaction terms.
Normalize or scale features to ensure stability during training.
# DATA PREPROCESSING 
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("creditcard.csv")

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
data['scaled_amount'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Amount'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
data['scaled_time'] = scaler.fit_transform(data['Time'].values.reshape(-1, 1))

# Drop original columns
data = data.drop(['Time', 'Amount'], axis=1)

# Separate features and labels
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']

# Split the dataset into training and testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)

print(f"Training set: {X_train.shape}, Test set: {X_test.shape}")
